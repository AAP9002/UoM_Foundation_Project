                            <p>Transitioning from A levels to university can be intimidating, especially with all the pressure put on your studies.
                                You may feel unsure or confused as to what you’ll have to do in your next year of education, or perhaps you’d like to just get a head start on the game. 
                                Whatever your reasons, this guide will have you covered with a comprehensive overview of what to expect on the Foundation Year Course.

                            The foundation year is broken into 12 units and 2 semesters, 6 units per semester. 
                            Each semester is 12 weeks long, encompassing coursework tests throughout its duration with exams at the end of term. 
                            Expect to be completing coursework tests approximately every week throughout the course. 
                            The majority of your grade will be achieved through exam results, though in order to pass you’ll need to keep a 50% average in coursework throughout the year. 
                            Unlike other courses at UOM, foundation year does not have reading weeks, so don’t base your study schedule off of your peers in first year!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In first semester you’ll sit four maths units, two physics/chemistry units (your choice) and two non-traditional units. 
                            These non-traditional units will focus on skills like group work, presentation skills and academic reading/referencing.
                            In second semester you’ll sit four maths units, and two group work focused computer science units.

                            Most of the mathematics units will overlook content you may have learnt at A level Maths and Further Maths, however much of this information will be recontextualised and taught slightly differently at the university level. 
                            Even if you’ve seen and read everything before, what you learn will be contextualised in a broader academic context, which you are unlikely to have learnt at A level. 
                            If you have never seen this level of maths before, don’t worry! You may find that the level of work required is higher than what you are used to, but it should be manageable with hard work and diligence. 
                            Even the difficult content is explained thoroughly in the core text, and there will be plenty of synchronous lessons to consolidate your knowledge.

                                <p>Foundation year moves more quickly than you might expect; 
                                    If you leave too much to the wayside, it can be very easy to get overwhelmed and left behind with weekly courseworks. 
                                    Your faculty will provide you with a week by week calendar of all the coursework deadlines for all units; 
                                    I recommend printing this out and pinning it on your wall, 
                                    keeping track of how things are moving around you week by week so you don’t lose track of your commitments.

                                    It can be very easy to fall into the trap of thinking “I’ll finish everything I need to do for unit A, and then move on to unit B”. 
                                    Whilst this mindset can sometimes be helpful, I think it is ultimately at a detriment to revising for one’s exams. 
                                    During the time you revise everything in unit B, you’ll be prone to forgetting what you had learnt previously in unit A. 
                                    Break up the content for all of your units, and make sure you practise it all regularly. 
                                    One way of doing this is to create your own question sheets by combining the questions from different tutorial sheets and practising those regularly, 
                                    so that you are constantly refreshing your memory on all the little parts of the course.
                                </p>

                                    Set rules and deadlines for yourself. 
                                    Ultimately you’re the one in charge, which means that it’s up to you to plan how you’re going to pass this course. 
                                    The university schedule will help, but it is unlikely you’ll be able to take this as your sole prescription of when to work.
                                    When setting aside time for revision, try time management techniques like pomodoro. 
                                    Create lists and tables to help you organise all outstanding activities to better plan your work schedule.

                            Alongside your scheduled lessons and core notes, there are a wealth of resources in and around UOM that can help you with your studies. 
                            Nearly all the faculty buildings you visit for lectures and tutorials will have quiet study spaces. 
                            You can find some secluded areas if you look hard enough! For casual study throughout the year,<a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/maps/interactive-map/?id=37">the Kilburn building</a>  is possibly one of the best buildings on campus. 
                            Moveable beanbags, 
                            Also take advantage of the <a href="https://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/">Universities’ online library</a>; 
                            you should be taught how to use this in your ICT unit, but it is still worth mentioning here. 
                            There is a veritable treasure trove there of books and papers that normally would be financially inaccessible. 
                            Pay close attention to the numerous ‘drop-in’ sessions run by your lecturers; these are open ended, optional sessions where you can ask questions and get one-to-one clarification on aspects of the course you’re unsure about. Your lecturers are an invaluable resource. Use them!
