                                position to you and might be just as nervous approaching others to form friendships.

                <h1>Societies</h1>
                <p style="text-align:center">Joining a society is another brilliant way to make friends. Societies 
                    are filled with like-minded people who wish to bond over a particular topic, 
                    activity, or sport, and they regularly hold social events as part of a group. 
                    There are over 100 different student societies and clubs at UOM alone – and that’s 
                    just one out of five universities in the region – meaning there really is something 
                    for everyone here.</p>

                                    Joining a society is a great idea for someone struggling to fit into a friendship group 
                                    around campus, so have a browse through the societies that are available at your university. 
                                    If nothing takes your fancy, you could even start your own society instead and encourage 
                                    people who share your interest to join.

                                    Feel like treating yourself? What better way than to hit the shops in Manchester! 
                                    There’s plenty of shopping centres to go and visit like the Manchester Arndale, 
                                    the intu Trafford Centre, as well as high street destinations like Market Street 
                                    and Exchange Square. If you’re feeling extra boujee, you need to head over to 
                                    Spinningfields, King Street and New Cathedral Street for the boutique districts. 
                                    Everybody loves a bit of glitz, which is why you need to visit the thriving Jewellery 
                                    quarter too, even if it might be a little pricey, there’s no harm in having a gander!

                                A night out in 42s (or its sister The Venue) is usually messy, dirty, cheap and 
                                soundtracked to all of those indie anthems that you remember from being a kid.
                                Dancing to Oasis in one of these places, sweat dripping off your head, £1 vodka 
                                mixer in your hand is one of the greatest experiences one can encounter in Manchester. 
                                You’ll also likely end up getting off with someone in these places too – they’re great 
                                for that kinda stuff.

                                If you’ve not heard of Hidden by the time you arrive here in Manchester, you’ll certainly 
                                know all about it in your first few weeks here. It’s just outside the city centre, in a 
                                place called Cheetham Hill, which you’ll have probably heard of due to all the shops here
                                selling fake clobber. Hidden though is one of the city’s best and most progressive clubs, 
                                with something to satisfy everyone pretty much every day of the week.

                            chicken tenders (£4.99) and Archie’s tots (£3.49) all come in sub fiver.
