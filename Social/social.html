                                <p>An important part to a functional university living is the social component. Whether you are
                                already a resident of Manchester or a prospective mancunian, knowing where to go, when to go 
                                and finding people to go with will be all part of the manchester experience that people 
                                cherish forever.</p>
                                <p>Starting a new course, attending lectures, seminars and going to workshops with other students
                                will evetually result in having to be paired up and group work (for those who struggle socialising,
                                this is a great way to make friends). But as much as one can avoid having to talk to people, and as 
                                scary as it may seem, it&#39;s going to have to be done so may as well kill two birds with one stone and 
                                make them friends!</p>

                            As with anything, making friends in your university life is going to require effort. Successful
                            friendships start with those who put themselves out there. Remember that most other student will 
                            just as nervous as making those lifelong bonds thta people cherish forever.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Despite all efforts however, there&#39;s no guaranteed formula that everyone that is met with a smile
                            will be those who will be an instant click but there&#39;s no harm in trying. Quite possibly, those in 
                            the same course will have a lot more in common than previosuly notioned. 
                            </p>

                                Making friends isn&#39;t easy. Not without some kind of effort. Rememebr to tag along
                                with people who might be going out to coffee, talk to people in between lectures, 
                                don&#39;t be afraid to go out rather than staying in your room. Have those night outs 
                                and enjoy!
