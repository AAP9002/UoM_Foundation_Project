                                Making friends at university is going to take some level of effort on your part, 
                                and it’s important to remember that most other people are going to be in a similar 
                                position to you and might be just as nervous approaching others to form friendships.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                                With five universities (The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University,
                                University of Salford, University of Bolton and University Academy 9) in the Manchester 
                                region and over 100’000 students enrolled across the city, there’s certainly no shortage 
                                of opportunity for bond-forming and friendship-making here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                You’re about to start a new course, be in lectures, seminars and workshops with strangers 
                                surrounding you and you’re going to eventually have to do paired and group work 
                                (which in itself, is a good way to make friends). So you’re going to HAVE to talk to 
                                people anyway, so you may as well make them your friends so it’s not painfully awkward. 
                                So, get ready.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                There’s no guarantee you’re going to click with others studying your course, but there’s
                                no harm in giving it a try. The chances are you’ll be able to find someone who had similar 
                                reasons for choosing the same subject as you, and you may have much more in common with 
                                your classmates than you first thought. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Once again, it’s so important to remember that all your peers are in the same boat as you
                                are. Reach out to others in your class to see if you have anything in common, and a new friendship 
                                may start to blossom!

                        Manchester is a city to be explored. Once you've met people, now it's time
                        to explore the great north. Where to go is now a question of the past with this great 
                        list of options to go to!

                    <p>
                        Feel like treating yourself? What better way than to hit the shops in Manchester! 
                        There’s plenty of shopping centres to go and visit like the Manchester Arndale, 
                        the intu Trafford Centre, as well as high street destinations like Market Street 
                        and Exchange Square. If you’re feeling extra boujee, you need to head over to 
                        Spinningfields, King Street and New Cathedral Street for the boutique districts. 
                        Everybody loves a bit of glitz, which is why you need to visit the thriving Jewellery 
                        quarter too, even if it might be a little pricey, there’s no harm in having a gander!

                    <h4>42nd Street/The Venue</h4>
                    <p>
                        A night out in 42s (or its sister The Venue) is usually messy, dirty, cheap and 
                        soundtracked to all of those indie anthems that you remember from being a kid.
                        Dancing to Oasis in one of these places, sweat dripping off your head, £1 vodka 
                        mixer in your hand is one of the greatest experiences one can encounter in Manchester. 
                        You’ll also likely end up getting off with someone in these places too – they’re great 
                        for that kinda stuff.

                    <p>
                        If you’ve not heard of Hidden by the time you arrive here in Manchester, you’ll certainly 
                        know all about it in your first few weeks here. It’s just outside the city centre, in a 
                        place called Cheetham Hill, which you’ll have probably heard of due to all the shops here
                        selling fake clobber. Hidden though is one of the city’s best and most progressive clubs, 
                        with something to satisfy everyone pretty much every day of the week.

                        fries, wraps and the rest of it for under a tenner. Curly fries (£2), 
                        chicken tenders (£4.99) and Archie’s tots (£3.49) all come in sub fiver.

                        extravaganza just sneaking over the tenner mark at £11, plus plenty of veggie/vegan 
                        options on the menu which are offered as a two-for-one on a Monday.

                        Run by the St Peter’s chaplaincy in the heart of the UoM campus, this is a wellness 
                        cafe with a difference. Veg soup for £3.75 from the plant-based menu, plus yoga and 
                        pilates classes mean you can nourish body and soul.

                <h2>Societies</h2>
                <p>
                    Joining a society is another brilliant way to make friends. Societies 
                    are filled with like-minded people who wish to bond over a particular topic, 
                    activity, or sport, and they regularly hold social events as part of a group. 
                    There are over 100 different student societies and clubs at UOM alone – and that’s 
                    just one out of five universities in the region – meaning there really is something 
                    for everyone here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joining a society is a great idea for someone struggling to fit into a friendship group 
                    around campus, so have a browse through the societies that are available at your university. 
                    If nothing takes your fancy, you could even start your own society instead and encourage 
                    people who share your interest to join.
