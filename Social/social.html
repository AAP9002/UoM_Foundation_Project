                                One of the most important factors to a healthy university life is the social aspect. 
                                But whether you’re a native mancunian or going to become a new resident of the beloved 
                                city of Manchester, knowing where to go, when to go and finding people to go with are 
                                the make or break of those memories that people cherish forever.

                                Making friends at university is going to take some level of effort on your part, 
                                and it’s important to remember that most other people are going to be in a similar 
                                position to you and might be just as nervous approaching others to form friendships.

                                With five universities (The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University,
                                University of Salford, University of Bolton and University Academy 9) in the Manchester 
                                region and over 100’000 students enrolled across the city, there’s certainly no shortage 
                                of opportunity for bond-forming and friendship-making here.

                                You’re about to start a new course, be in lectures, seminars and workshops with strangers 
                                surrounding you and you’re going to eventually have to do paired and group work 
                                (which in itself, is a good way to make friends). So you’re going to HAVE to talk to 
                                people anyway, so you may as well make them your friends so it’s not painfully awkward. 
                                So, get ready.
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>
                                There’s no guarantee you’re going to click with others studying your course, but there’s
                                no harm in giving it a try. The chances are you’ll be able to find someone who had similar 
                                reasons for choosing the same subject as you, and you may have much more in common with 
                                your classmates than you first thought. 
                            </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>
                                Once again, it’s so important to remember that all your peers are in the same boat as you
                                are. Reach out to others in your class to see if you have anything in common, and a new friendship 
                                may start to blossom!
