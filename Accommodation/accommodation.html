                <p>The majority of students coming to university will be moving away from home for the first time which, while exciting, can also be a daunting experience. There are a variety of accommodation options to suit every individual's needs and wants.</p>
                <p>Rooms can be catered or self catered, ensuite or shared bathrooms and come with different sized beds, desks and more. These rooms can be either booked through university accommodation (halls) or private accommodation.</p>
                <p>Applications are simple and there&#39;s plenty of options within walking distance from the campus with convenient transport. Most accommodations offer bills included, utilities on site and a variety of rooms to suit your needs and budget. These are offered in 43 or 50 week contracts, spanning your academic year.</p>

            <div class="w-50">
                <p>Starting university is an exciting time and living in university halls is a great way to meet other students, build friendships, and live with people from a variety of different backgrounds. Manchester halls of residence aren't just accommodation but their own communities, where many Manchester students make friends for life.</p>
                <p>There are plenty of exciting events and opportunities life in halls has to offer. Every hall offers an extensive range of facilities, from computer clusters and libraries, to sports and bars, meaning you'll never be short of things to do or ways to socialise and relax.</p>

        <h1>Private</h1>
        <div class="d-flex">
            <div class="w-50">
                <p>Choosing private accommodation can offer more control over the location, preferences and in some cases the ability to choose the exact room. Offering the same services as university accommodation, it is an ideal alternate. You can rent studios, 2-8 bed flats and houses, requesting to share flats with friends. The only difference from halls is you may be placed with students who have completed their first year.</p>
