                    <p>The majority of students coming to university will be moving away from home for the first time
                        which, while exciting, can also be a daunting experience. There are a variety of accommodation
                        options to suit every individual&#39;s needs and wants.</p>
                    <p>Rooms can be catered or self catered, ensuite or shared bathrooms and come with different sized
                        beds, desks and more. These rooms can be either booked through university accommodation (halls)
                        or private accommodation.</p>
                    <p>Applications are simple and there&#39;s plenty of options within walking distance from the campus
                        with convenient transport. Most accommodations offer bills included, utilities on site and a
                        variety of rooms to suit your needs and budget. These are offered in 43 or 50 week contracts,
                        spanning your academic year.</p>

        <h3>Our accommodation is set across three main areas, all within easy reach of the campus, the city and
            amenities. Each area offers something different but all offer a great place to live and study.</h3>

            <div>
                <p>Starting university is an exciting time and living in university halls is a great way to meet other
                    students, build friendships, and live with people from a variety of different backgrounds.
                    Manchester halls of residence aren&#39;t just accommodation but their own communities, where many
                    Manchester students make friends for life.</p>
                <p>There are plenty of exciting events and opportunities life in halls has to offer. Every hall offers
                    an extensive range of facilities, from computer clusters and libraries, to sports and bars, meaning
                    you&#39;ll never be short of things to do or ways to socialise and relax.</p>

                <u>Key Points</u>
                <ul>
                    <li>You need a university ID found on your UCAS Offer letter before applying</li>
                    <li>You choose your top 5 preferred accommodations you wish to be placed</li>
                    <li>The initial application is free</li>
                    <li>You will receive a room offer via email outlining rent, utilities and more</li>
                    <li>An £400 deposit is needed to secure your room (refunded if course is not started by student)
                    </li>

            <div>
                <p>Choosing private accommodation can offer more control over the location, preferences and in some
                    cases the ability to choose the exact room. Offering the same services as university accommodation,
                    it is an ideal alternate. You can rent studios, 2-8 bed flats and houses, requesting to share flats
                    with friends. The only difference from halls is you may be placed with students who have completed
                    their first year.</p>
