                    <h4>Andrew</h4>
                    <p>
                                    Before attending Manchester university, I studied A level Computer science, 
                                    Chemistry and Physics and as of now, I’ve had a good time in the foundation year. 
                                    Comparing the foundation year to my previous school, the style of learning and 
                                    approach has been almost the same with the quality of information and presentation 
                                    has been great, but in the foundation year It has been straight to the point with 
                                    topics and lectures being rather fast paced to ensure students get all the 
                                    knowledge needed for exams in a small period. Regardless of this, the addition 
                                    of coursework and project work does help alleviate some stress from the exams 
                                    as not all the marks are dependent on an exam. During the project too, you build 
                                    upon your team work skills and develop your individual skills making you a more 
                                    confident and open person in group projects and group reliant activities both in 
                                    and out of the course. I recommend the course for as it helps build upon skills 
                                    you have and learn new skills required for [said] topic you would like to progress 
                                    onto.

                    <h4>Alan</h4>
                    <p>
                                    I studied A-Level Computer Science, Mathematics and Economics at College 
                                    and have enjoyed the foundation year so far. The blended learning approach 
                                    to content, delivered on blackboard online and live in-person sessions, works 
                                    really well and gives you time to catch up. Being more structured than college,
                                    it is easier to plan and organise work, however you need to be disciplined to stay 
                                    up to date. I did struggle with the science units, not having done them in A-level
                                     studies, but multiple coursework tests reduces the weight of exams which 
                                     significantly helps. Group work was a skill I lacked, where this course addresses 
                                     the importance of it. The skills I am learning will certainly help my further 
                                     studies and I highly recommend this foundation year for Computer Science.

                    <p>
                                    Coming out of A level college, I was disappointed that my grades weren’t as 
                                    high as I’d hoped. If your situation sounds any bit similar to mine, then I 
                                    would definitely recommend the Foundation Year course as an option for your 
                                    degree course. Not only does it offer a “second chance” to get onto some of the 
                                    UK’s most highly rated courses, you’ll also be armed with an excellent introduction
                                    to university life. This course will challenge you in new ways, recontextualising 
                                    what you may have already seen into both the academic discipline and the university
                                    structure. I’ve personally found the foundation year to be challenging in all the 
                                    right ways, and have been instrumental in developing both my individual and group 
                                    skills. All the while I’ve found this course to be engaging and interesting, so 
                                    I am very excited to continue my studies next year.

                    <p>
                                    The Integrated Foundation Year is very much a great opportunity for 
                                    those who would like to have a place at University of Manchester despite 
                                    not having the required grades. The grade requirements for Computer Science 
                                    for example is A*A*A*, which not every student is capable of achieving no matter 
                                    how talented an individual may be. So this course is one step in the door which 
                                    will allow you to enter your chosen course. But it is also so much more than that. 
                                    I think it’s a course designed to ensure you have every opportunity of passing as 
                                    well as giving students a taste of the university life other students don’t 
                                    really have the chance of having. I wouldn’t say it is at all a waste of a year 
                                    as some may deem but an opportunity to understand university life and experience 
                                    it fully.
